# Project-3-Identifying-Malaria-Infections-with-Image-Classification

This project is an attempt to use image classification to build a simple predicitive model, to determine if cells are paraticized or uninfected by Malaria. We used tensor flow and keras to reach an accuracy of roughly ~95% when the model was used on new an unique test data.

## Section 1
### Software and platform section
We used R studio software to complete this project. This in conjunction with the Keras package we were able to create a predicitive model that could accuratly identitfy paraticized Malaria Cells (~95% accuracy). The Keras package in R allows for R to build deep learning algorithms and neural networks. This allows us to build a neural network that can correctly predict weather or not a cell has Malaria. The Keras package is actually an API that directly interfaces with the tools and software on Tensorflow by google. The data gathered from this was further synthesized and visualized using ggplot2 in R. This gave us an accurate model and informative diagrams and graphs to explain it. 



## Section 2
### Navigating the Github
This github is divided into three sections; Data, Scripts, Output. In the data folder there is a link to the data set we used, A data dictionary for the final data frame we created, and a data Appendix which contains all of our graphs diagrams and charts we produced during our research. The Scripts folder contains the scripts needed to clean and build the predicitive model. There is only one script in this folder and it is the only script needed to reproduce our results. The output folder contains a number of graphs, tables, and diagrams that we produced during our research. These visualizations and tables contain the results of our research.




## Section 3
### Reproducing Results
The reproduction of our study is very straight forward and simple. First access the data through the link in the data folder. This will lead you to a kaggle page where you can download the data. If you want the primary source for the data feel free to access it on the NIH website. This data needs to be saved to the same loaction as the R project. Once the data is downloaded unzip the file in the desired location. Once the file is unzipped download the R scripts needed to build and analyse the predicitive model. Make sure the file paths have been correctly modified to access the data how you have it organized our your computer. Once this script is run the output will be the results of the model building and testing. This should closely match the results produced in the Github.
